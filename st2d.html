					Sapphire Tears 2D was an attempt to "demake" a popular Game Maker First Person Shooter known as <a href="https://www.64digits.com/user/Requiem/game/3654" target="_blank">Sapphire Tears</a>. The unique aspect of the game was that every match started with a blank play area, and players would be alloted a small amount of time to build out a map before the round using the game's built in creation tools. Whilst my own take on it never got too far, I was able to implement basic multiplayer and base building with all players on the server along with some basic combat features and map saving. This project was created using Game Maker and an external library known as 39dll for the networking aspect. I learned a lot about how networking, multiplayer games, and more about game creation in general during the time I spent working on this project. Below are a few screenshots from the game.
